                <h2>Cloud Solutions Architect and Engineer</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Pete. I'm a cloud solutions architect and engineer living in Scotland - close to the midpoint between its two biggest cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been in the software development space for over 15 years. I've worked my way up from junior engineer, to senior, to architect. I've fulfilled many roles: pure development, tech lead and solution architect, and have headed up teams on numerous occasions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have primarily focused on the Microsoft web stack - .NET and Azure - for the last 12 years, but am also familiar with the other mainstream cloud platforms. Additionally, I have significant experience with the React, Angular and Blazor technologies and ecosystems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked on many projects over the years for big and small companies alike; Microsoft, Arnold Clark, Tesco Bank, Dyson, Lloyd's of London, Mediacom, The Macallan, to name a few.
                </p>
