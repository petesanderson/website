            <h2>Pete Sanderson - .NET Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Pete. I'm a software developer living in Scotland - close to the midpoint between its two biggest cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been in the software development space for over 15 years. I've worked my way up from junior engineer, to senior, to architect. I've fulfilled many roles: pure development, tech lead and solution architect, and have headed up teams on numerous occasions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am primarily a .NET developer. I've focused on the Microsoft web stack and Azure cloud for the last 12 years, but am also familiar with the other mainstream cloud platforms. Additionally, I have a significant experience with the React, Angular and Blazor technologies and ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have worked on many projects over the years for big and small companies alike; Microsoft, Tesco Bank, Dyson, Lloyd's of London, Mediacom, The Macallan, to name a few.
            </p>
